It is not exactly as in the photo. We have added another layer (lambda function) that hides the real call of the step function in order to avoid the leak of information.
	This is done by the creation of a lambda function (known by the client through the API Gateway) which calls the step function. We have added an intermediator 
	between the API Gateway and the Step Function!
