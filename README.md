# Business Process Automation

The  following  project is  focused  on discovering the  field  of  the  automation  of  business processes.  For  that  purpose,  one  of  the  multiple workflow  engines (AWS  Step  Functions) is studied and applied into a possible use case by following a serverless framework. The use case built is about a parking system, in which cars can be registered and removed from the system. In order to achieve this objective, a workflow is designed.
